## Hi there 👋
I’m Sheena, a Maths and Computer Science graduate from South Africa who loves building anything I can imagine. If an idea pops into my head, there’s a very high chance I’ll try to code it, break it, fix it, and eventually ship it.

I work across the stack and enjoy turning concepts into real projects. I love experimenting, learning new tools, and tinkering with anything tech-related. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me watching anime ( Bleach and Seven Deadly Sins are my all-time favourites). I also have a dog named Haku, who thinks she’s my project manager.

Fun facts about me:
  * I've actually been coding since I was 8 years old (my dad was a CS teacher and my first programming code was delphi).

  * I haven’t had coffee in over 9 years (somehow still alive).

  * I love anime, art, and building cool things.

  * I get way too excited about new project ideas… and then end up starting five at once.

## If you’re curious about how I build things or just want to chat about tech or anime, feel free to reach out!
